talking into consideration everything what we've done so far create a documentation for this app that will have:
	Application description: 2 paragraphs, 4-10 Sentences.
	Information on how to run the developed application locally.
	At least 10 examples of how to use the developed endpoint.

Absolutely, let's draft that README.md:

ChatGPT Country API Documentation
Application Description
The ChatGPT Country API is a dynamic web service designed to provide detailed information on countries. With its rich set of features, it allows users to filter countries based on specific criteria, sort the data, and even paginate results. Whether you're seeking country data based on population, names, or codes, this API offers a robust and efficient way to access it.

Built on ASP.NET Core, it leverages the efficiency and security of modern web applications. The API sources its data from a trusted third-party service, ensuring the reliability and accuracy of the information provided. Additionally, with its well-structured endpoints, developers can seamlessly integrate this service into their applications or tools.

Running the Application Locally
