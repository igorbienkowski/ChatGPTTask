now i need to create pagination function.
o	Create a function that accepts numbers as an attribute and can limit the number of records. 
o	The functionality should accept a number and retrieve first n records (e.g., providing number `15` I should receive 15 first records from API).

Pagination can greatly improve the user experience and system performance, especially when dealing with a lot of data. Here's how you can implement basic pagination in your service and controller:

Pagination Service:
I'll add the pagination function to the ICountryFilterSortService:

csharp
Copy code
public interface ICountryFilterSortService
{
    // ... existing methods ...
    IEnumerable<Country> Paginate(IEnumerable<Country> countries, int recordsLimit);
}

public class CountryFilterSortService : ICountryFilterSortService
{
    // ... existing methods ...

    public IEnumerable<Country> Paginate(IEnumerable<Country> countries, int recordsLimit)
    {
        return countries.Take(recordsLimit);
    }
}
Update the Controller:
csharp
Copy code
[ApiController]
[Route("[controller]")]
public class CountriesController : ControllerBase
{
    private readonly ICountryService _countryService;
    private readonly ICountryFilterSortService _filterSortService;

    public CountriesController(ICountryService countryService, ICountryFilterSortService filterSortService)
    {
        _countryService = countryService;
        _filterSortService = filterSortService;
    }

    [HttpGet]
    public async Task<IEnumerable<Country>> Get(
        [FromQuery] string? filter, 
        [FromQuery] int? maxPopulationInMillions,
        [FromQuery] bool sortByName = false,
        [FromQuery] int? recordsLimit = null)  // Add this line
    {
        IEnumerable<Country> countries = await _countryService.GetAllCountriesAsync();

        // ... filtering and sorting logic ...

        if (recordsLimit.HasValue)
        {
            countries = _filterSortService.Paginate(countries, recordsLimit.Value);
        }

        return countries;
    }
}
Dependency Injection:
Ensure that the pagination service (which is part of CountryFilterSortService) is registered for DI. As you have already done this in previous steps, there's no change here.

By following the approach above, you can easily add pagination to your API. However, this is basic pagination. In real-world scenarios, you might also want to consider adding functionalities like "skip" (to skip a certain number of records), especially if you want to implement things like "next page" or "previous page".
